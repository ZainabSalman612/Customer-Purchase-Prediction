## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for predicting customer purchases based on their website interaction patterns. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment through an interactive web interface.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 **Core Functionality**
- **Real-time Predictions**: Interactive web app with sliders and dropdowns
- **Dual ML Models**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest for comparison
- **Business Insights**: Color-coded recommendations based on purchase likelihood
- **Synthetic Dataset**: 100 customer records with realistic behavior patterns

### 🔍 **Customer Behavior Analysis**
- **Time on Site**: How long customers spend browsing (0-60 minutes)
- **Pages Viewed**: Number of pages visited (1-20 pages)
- **Device Type**: Mobile, desktop, or tablet usage
- **Referral Source**: How customers found the website (Google, Facebook, Direct, Email, Other)

### 🤖 **Machine Learning Pipeline**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Label encoding for categorical variables, feature scaling
- **Model Training**: Automated training on startup with 80/20 train-test split
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy and precision metrics (~60-65% performance)
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoded categorical variables and scaled numeric features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (optional, for cloning)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd customer-purchase-prediction
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate environment**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate

## 🎮 Usage

### Option 1: Interactive Web App (Recommended)
Launch the Streamlit application for instant predictions:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8502` in your browser.

**Features:**
- Pre-trained models load automatically on startup
- Adjust customer characteristics with interactive controls
- Get real-time purchase probability predictions
- View business recommendations based on likelihood scores

### Option 2: Command Line Script
Run the complete ML pipeline programmatically:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

**Output:**
- Generates synthetic customer data
- Trains both ML models
- Displays model performance metrics
- Shows data statistics and preprocessing results

### Option 3: Jupyter Notebook
Explore the data and models interactively:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/customer_purchase_prediction.ipynb
```

**Includes:**
- Step-by-step data analysis
- Model training walkthrough
- Visualization of results
- Feature importance analysis

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

### Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**: Interpretable linear model for probability estimation
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for higher accuracy through decision trees

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: ~60-65% on test data
- **Precision**: ~50-60% for positive purchase predictions
- **Training Size**: 80 samples (80% of dataset)
- **Test Size**: 20 samples (20% of dataset)

### Feature Importance (Random Forest)
1. Time on site (most important)
2. Pages viewed
3. Device type
4. Referral source

## 🎨 Web App Interface

### Input Controls
- **Time on Site**: Slider (0-60 minutes)
- **Pages Viewed**: Slider (1-20 pages)
- **Device**: Dropdown (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet)
- **Referral Source**: Dropdown (Google, Facebook, Direct, Email, Other)

### Output Display
- **Probability Scores**: From both Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- **Business Recommendations**:
  - 🟢 **High Likelihood** (>60%): Consider targeted promotions
  - 🟡 **Moderate Likelihood** (40-60%): Monitor engagement
  - 🔴 **Low Likelihood** (<40%): Focus on conversion optimization

## 📊 Dataset Information

The synthetic dataset includes 100 customer records with:
- **Balanced Classes**: ~40% purchase rate
- **Realistic Distributions**: Time follows exponential decay, pages are normally distributed
- **Categorical Balance**: Even distribution across device types and referral sources
